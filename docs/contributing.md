Thanks for your interest in contributing to gdbgui!

If your change is small, go ahead and submit a pull request. If it is substantial, create a GitHub issue to discuss it before making the change.

## Development Instructions

gdbgui uses [https://github.com/theacodes/nox](nox) for to automate various tasks. You will need it installed on your system before continuing.

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui
cd gdbgui
nox -s develop-3.7  # replace with desired Python version
source .nox/develop-3.7/bin/activate  # replace with desired Python version
```

You are now in a virtual environment with gdbgui's dependencies installed. When finished, type `deactivate` to leave the virtual environment.

### Step 2: Compile JavaScript Code

gdbgui compiles JavaScript source code into a single .js file.

Note that `yarn` can be replaced with `npm`:

First install JavaScript dependencies:
```bash
yarn install

To watch JavaScript files for changes and build non-optimized code for each change, use
```
yarn start
```

This is useful for iterating on changes.

To build once for production-optimized code, you can run
```
yarn build
```

### Step 3: Run Python server

```bash
python -m gdbgui --debug
```

The `--debug` flag:

1.  Automatically reloads the server when it detects changes you've made
1.  Adds a new component at the bottom of the right sidebar called "gdb machine interface output" that displays the raw gdb mi output to help you debug.
1.  Displays all changes to state data in the browser's developer console, such as `rendered_source_file_fullname null -> /home/chad/git/gdbgui/examples/hello.c`


### Step 4: Make your changes

Open the browser to view gdbgui. Refresh the page as you make changes to JavaScript code.

!!! Note

    Make sure you have caching turned off in your browser. In Chrome, for example, this is a setting in the developer console.

### Step 5: Run and Add tests

To continue, you must have nox installed.

```bash
nox
```

runs gdbgui unit tests.

If you have changed any Python code, add new tests to `gdbgui/tests/test_app.py` as necessary.

JavaScript tests are minimal, so you will have to manually excercise any code paths that may be affected.

## Documentation

### Modifying Documentation
Documentation is made with `mkdocs`. Then make changes to `mkdocs.yml` or md files in the `docs` directory.

To build docs, run
```
nox -s docs
```

To see a live preview of current documentation, run
```
nox -s watch_docs
```

### Publishing Documentation
The generated documentation is published to the `gh-pages` branch.
```
nox -s publish_docs
```

## Publishing a New Version to PyPI

Each time a new version of gdbgui is created, a package needs to be published to PyPI and executables need to be built.

From the root of gdbgui, run:

```
nox -s publish
```

Make sure the version number is incremented in VERSION.txt and in applicable READMEs.

### Building Binary Executables

To build Ubuntu and Windows executables, run from any operating system:

```
nox -s docker_executables
```

To build macOS executable, run the following on a mac:

```
nox -s build_executable_current_os
```

When creating a new release, build these executables, then create a new release in GitHub and attach the binaries to the release through GitHub's UI.
